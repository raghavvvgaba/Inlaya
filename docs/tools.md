# Tools

Canonical developer-facing contracts for sandbox tools live here.

This file is the current source of truth for tool behavior that the app and future agent layers should rely on.

## `glob_files`

Purpose: Find files inside the sandbox repo by path pattern.

Input:
- `sessionId: string`
- `patterns: string[]`
- `path?: string`

Output:
- `paths: string[]`
- `truncated: boolean`
- `cap: 100`

Behavior:
- patterns use ripgrep glob syntax
- leading `!` patterns exclude matching files
- paths are repository-relative and sorted
- respects ignore files and skips generated/dependency directories
- returns at most `100` paths
- `truncated=true` means more matching paths may exist
- caller should narrow the path or patterns and retry

Example patterns:
- `src/**/*.tsx`
- `**/*.{ts,js}`
- `!**/*.test.ts`

## `search_code`

Purpose: Search code inside the sandbox repo.

Input:
- `sessionId: string`
- `query: string`
- `path?: string`
- `include?: string[]`
- `regex?: boolean`

Output:
- `matches: array`
- `truncated: boolean`
- `caps: { total: 10, perFile: 2 }`

Each match includes:
- `path: string`
- `line: number`
- `column: number`
- `text: string`

Limits:
- max `10` matches total
- max `2` matches per file

Behavior:
- literal text search by default
- `regex=true` interprets `query` as a ripgrep regular expression
- `include` limits searched files with ripgrep glob patterns and supports leading `!` exclusions
- returns single-line matches only
- skips hidden files by default
- `truncated=true` means result cap was hit
- more matches may exist
- does not support pagination
- caller should narrow query/path and retry

Examples:
- `{ query: "Full stack developer", include: ["**/*.{jsx,tsx}"] }`
- `{ query: "use(State|Effect)", include: ["src/**/*.tsx", "!**/*.test.tsx"], regex: true }`

## `replace_in_file`

Purpose: Replace exact text on one inspected line.

Input:
- `sessionId: string`
- `path: string`
- `startLine: number`
- `oldText: string`
- `newText: string`

Output:
- `path: string`
- `startLine: number`
- `oldText: string`
- `newText: string`
- `session: SandboxSession`

Behavior:
- `startLine` is 1-based, matching `read_file`
- reads the current file before writing
- normalizes line endings to `\n`
- target line must exist
- target line must contain `oldText` exactly once
- when the target line does not contain `oldText`, the failure returns up to `5` candidate line numbers where it appears elsewhere
- caller should inspect a candidate line with `read_file` before retrying
- writes the full updated file through the sandbox provider
- use this for targeted line edits instead of full-file `write_file`
